# Innovative Idea

The idea of our application Liner generally revolves around the idea of efficiently picking up food. We live in a very busy world where time is everything, we want to help people get some time back by having them avoid lines. This app essentially lets our users order food based on venue and let them choose off the menu for pick up. The app will return to the user an estimate of when the food will be done, and when it’s done it will notify our user. This will in turn not only save our user’s time but also help the food venue from overcrowding customers.
There are similar applications out there such as Grubhub and other delivery services, but they mainly target restaurants. Our app on the other hand targets “fast-food” places, such as McDonalds, Baby berk, and other similarly established venues.
